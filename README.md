Drawing 3D Perspective on a 2D canvas
=====================


## This is a bunch of C++ projects based on openFrameworks (of 0.9.4) on top of OpenGL

### It requires a compatible openFrameworks and it needs to be 2 levels down from the main " of_v0.9.4 " folder (same level as "myApps")


### Current projects:

- Fractals:
a simple sketch that calculates the Mandelbrot set and draws it to screen

- SuperFormula:
C++ Implementation of the superformula and a tunnel-like graphics made using translation and rotation of concentric circles

- Week3Lab:
a simple 3D engine using perspective projection to draw 3D verteces on a 2D canvass

- ProceduralSphere:
a simple geometric plotting of verteces to generate a sphere procedurally
