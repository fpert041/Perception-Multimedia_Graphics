Drawing 3D Perspective on a 2D canvas
=====================


## This is a bunch of C++ projects based on openFrameworks (of 0.9.4) on top of OpenGL

### It requires a compatible openFrameworks and it needs to be 2 levels down from the main " of_v0.9.4 " folder (same level as "myApps")


### Current projects:

- Week3Lab:
